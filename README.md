# Luminex Data Extractor

A Python script for processing and analyzing Luminex assay data (currently only tested on Luminex Intelliflex files). This tool enables users to import Luminex CSV output files (e.g. direct exports from Luminex machines), apply a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) standard curve fit, interpolate unknown sample concentrations, and identify additional samples for further dilution/testing.

## Features

- GUI interface for selecting input files and analytes
- Supports standard 4PL curve fitting for each analyte
- Calculates interpolated concentrations for unknowns
- Flags samples that fall outside of fit bounds or show poor fitting
- Generates plots of standard curves with sample points
- Outputs clean, analysis-ready CSV results

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tkinter`
- `scipy`

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

> Note: `tkinter` is included in most Python installations by default. On macOS, use `python3 -m tkinter` to test if it's available.

## Standards File Format

The standards CSV file should contain known concentrations for each analyte, formatted as follows:

| Analyte    | Concentration | 
|------------|---------------|
| Standard1  | 1000          |
| Standard2  | 500           |
| Standard3  | 250           | 

- Each row is a standard concentration for the analyte(s)
- In this case, the Standard1 through to Standard8 is used across all analytes

## Cut off files

Optional inclusion - If there are defined cut offs established for your assays (e.g., interpolated cut offs) these can be use to classify samples as positive/negative as well

## Output Files

After analysis, the script generates:

###  Luminex Data Extractor - Output Files Overview

This document provides a summary of the output files generated by the Luminex Data Extractor script. The script processes Luminex plate reader data, fits standard curves using 4-parameter logistic regression, calculates concentrations, and generates various output files with results and visualizations.

### Output Directory Structure

When you run the Luminex Data Extractor, it creates the following directory structure:

```
{output_prefix}_graphs/             # Main output directory
├── analytes/                       # Individual analyte files
│   ├── {analyte}_results.csv       # Individual analyte results
│   └── {analyte}_efficiency.csv    # Efficiency data for each analyte
├── {analyte}_standard_curve.png    # Standard curve plots (for easy viewing)
├── {output_prefix}_combined_results.csv   # Combined results for all analytes
├── {output_prefix}_efficiency_data.csv    # Efficiency data (long format)
├── {output_prefix}_efficiency_pivot.csv   # Efficiency data (pivot table)
├── {output_prefix}_hook_effect_data.csv   # Hook effect information
├── {output_prefix}_samples_to_retest.csv  # Samples needing retesting
└── Unused_data_run_{timestamp}.csv        # Metadata removed from original file
```

### Main Output Files

### Combined Results File
- **Filename:** `{output_prefix}_combined_results.csv`
- **Description:** Contains all sample results for all analyzed analytes.
- **Key fields:**
  - Sample name and location (if available)
  - `Is_Standard` and `Is_Background` flags
  - For each analyte:
    - `{analyte}_Conc`: Raw concentration
    - `{analyte}_Final_Conc`: Concentration after applying dilution factor
    - `{analyte}_Avg_Efficiency`: Average standard curve efficiency
    - Various sample quality flags (see below)

### Standard Efficiency Files
- **Filename:** `{output_prefix}_efficiency_data.csv` and `{output_prefix}_efficiency_pivot.csv`
- **Description:** Data showing how well the fitted curve predicts expected standard values.
- **Formats:**
  - Long format: Contains Analyte, Concentration, and Efficiency columns
  - Pivot table: Rows are concentrations, columns are analytes

### Hook Effect Data
- **Filename:** `{output_prefix}_hook_effect_data.csv`
- **Description:** Information about hook effects detected in each analyte's standard curve.
- **Key fields:**
  - `Analyte`: Name of the analyte
  - `Hook_Detected`: Whether hook effect was detected (True/False)
  - `Hook_Concentration`: Concentration at which hook effect begins
  - `Standards_Excluded`: Number of standards excluded due to hook effect

### Samples to Retest
- **Filename:** `{output_prefix}_samples_to_retest.csv`
- **Description:** List of samples that need retesting (typically at lower dilutions).
- **Format:** Matrix with samples as rows and analytes as columns. "Yes" indicates retest needed.

### Unused Data 
This is all other elements of the csv file export from the Intelliflex output, e.g., MeanFI instead of MedianFI
- **Filename:** `Unused_data_run_{timestamp}.csv`
- **Description:** Metadata removed from the original file during preprocessing.

### Individual Analyte Files

Further details on the plots are found below, with examples at the end.

### Standard Curve Plots
- **Filename:** `{analyte}_standard_curve.png`
- **Description:** Visual representation of the standard curve for each analyte.
- **Contains:**
  - Standard curve with concentration on x-axis
  - Log10 MFI vs concentration plot
  - Standard efficiency vs concentration plot
  - Hook effect indication (if detected and enabled)

### Individual Analyte Results
- **Filename:** `analytes/{analyte}_results.csv`
- **Description:** Detailed results for a specific analyte.
- **Key fields:**
  - Sample name and location (if available)
  - Raw MFI values and background-corrected MFI
  - Calculated concentrations (raw and final)
  - Quality flags

### Analyte Efficiency Data
- **Filename:** `analytes/{analyte}_efficiency.csv`
- **Description:** Efficiency data for each concentration point in the standard curve.

### Sample Quality Flags

The script adds several flags to help identify quality issues:

1. **`{analyte}_Below_Min_MFI`**: Value is 1 if raw MFI is below the lowest standard MFI or negative after background subtraction.
   - For standards: Flag set to NaN (not applicable)
   - For background samples: Flag set to 1 (always considered negative)

2. **`{analyte}_Below_Cutoff`**: Value is 1 if interpolated concentration is below the defined cutoff.
   - For standards: Flag set to NaN (not applicable)
   - For background samples: Flag set to 1 (always considered negative)
   - For samples below Min MFI: Automatically flagged as below cutoff

3. **`{analyte}_Above_Max_MFI`**: Value is 1 if raw MFI is above the highest reliable standard's MFI.
   - For standards and background: Flag set to NaN (not applicable)
   - For samples above Max MFI: Should be rerun with more dilution

4. **`{analyte}_In_Hook_Zone`**: Value is 1 if the sample might be affected by the hook effect.
   - For standards and background: Flag set to NaN (not applicable)
   - For samples in hook zone: May have unreliable interpolated values

## Example PNG plots

Each analyte generates a curve-fit plot saved as `StandardCurve_<Analyte>.png` showing:
- Standard curve with fitted 4PL curve
- Standard curve with fitted 4PL curve (Log10)
- Efficiency plot for the standard curves

An example output of a normal run, with standards working well and no overfitting

An example output, whereby 4PL curve is fitted but does not use standards whereby hook effect is observed:
